The previous AI engineer effectively navigated the initial phases of building the ICAA alumni website, demonstrating a methodical approach. Starting from Phase 1, the engineer successfully established the core application, including a Home page, Membership with Stripe integration (using emergent integration), Contact Us, News, and a Newsletter viewing page. Key decisions involved using  for initial setup and then granular edits. The engineer proactively gathered branding assets and images. After a  test report, the engineer pivoted to manual  tests and  for verification, effectively debugging and proving functionality for backend API and frontend display. User feedback led to dynamic adjustments, such as initially removing and then restoring the admin dashboard with PDF upload for newsletters, and integrating custom logo and photos. Subsequently, the engineer initiated Phase 2, implementing event management with manual event creation, capacity limits, and email notifications. Phases 4 (Document Repository) and 5 (Merchandise Shop) were implemented concurrently, including database population and frontend pages. The final task in the trajectory involves creating About Us and Board Members pages with provided content and an image.
